2. Verify the gitpage after 2min with cine browser
3. Once step 2 is ok, open the page to the user and ask for a confirmation
4. If the verification step 2 failed, retry 3 times with a 1min internal to confirm if page is looking ok.
5. If the verification of the context is no good, revisit the html files to fix it and then go to step 1.
