1. update the index.html page with the new pages added.
2. push to main branch after commit
3. Verify the gitpage after 2min with Cline built-in browser
4. Once step 2 is ok, open the page to the user and ask for a confirmation
5. If the verification step 2 failed, retry 3 times with a 1min interval to confirm if page is looking ok.
6. If the verification of the context is no good, revisit the html files to fix it and then go to step 1.
